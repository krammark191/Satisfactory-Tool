# Overview

Description:

This program is designed as a directory for a game called Satisfactory. The way it works is it stores every item in the game in the form of maps, and there is a category map for all the item maps. When an item is selected the program then displays information about the item that is pertinent to the game. I designed the program with cohesion in mind to have each class and function as specific as possible. All the items and category map of maps are in one class, and display functions are in another class, and recipe storage and such are in other classes. Items maps are selected via 'when' statements.

Purpose:

This project was created for two reasons: to learn the Kotlin language and to create a piece of software that I can actually use in my life. When I set out to create the progam I decided that I wanted to both learn Kotlin without creating garbage software that I never actually use.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Tools Used:

* IntelliJ IDEA
* GitHub
* Android Studio

I initially chose Android Studio for this project, as I plan on using the code I've created to build an android app, but I realized that I needed a more focused editor, so I settled on IntelliJ IDEA, as it specializes in Kotlin and is much more focused.

Languages and Libraries:

* Kotlin
* Java.util.scanner (for integer inputs)

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin Language](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

# Future Work

* Only a few items are actually set up, I plan to finish info for every item.
* Add items recipes into the program.
* Add stack functionality for adding search history.
